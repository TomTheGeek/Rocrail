Chesapeake and Ohio theme from the 1989 rulebook on Railroad Signals of the US website based on SpDrS60 theme. This rulebook is a superset of the earlier 1957 and 1969 rulebooks so can be used for earlier installations by ignoring the flashing aspect but not all the variations of aspect found in the 1957 rulebook are present.

This is an interesting system in that there is no lunar and dark on the lower head has distinct meaning different from red, green and yellow. Stop - rule 292 red/red/(dark) - is not available on a single head mast, the most restrictive single head aspect being stop and proceed.
