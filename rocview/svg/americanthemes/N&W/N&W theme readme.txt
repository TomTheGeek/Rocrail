Note that it is not possible to show all aspects on dwarf colour position light heads heads because it requires that the green lamp required for R287 be replaced with a yellow lamp for R288 (left hand) or R290 (right hand). Also some aspects are modified by the presence of number plates so that for example R290 and R292 cannot both be shown on a single head searchlight dwarf. Since it is not possible to include the number plates in the SVG images care must be taken to only use the aspects available for the location and not all that are available in the aspect set.
